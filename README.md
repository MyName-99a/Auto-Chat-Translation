# What is it for?
It is a simple Python tool created for the <b>LEAGUE OF LEGENDS AND VALORANT CHAT</b>, to translate your messages into any Language you want, using the Google Translate library.

# How to use
The default settings are translation from 'English' to 'German' and all the translated text is in proper capitalization
Hotkeys are shown in the program

Write some text in the chat and press the 'right shift' key on your keyboard and it will replace your input with the translation

# Known Bugs
1. If the word/sentence that you want to translate is ending with a 'space' the translation process won't work
2. After you have translated 3 words/sentences and you'll press 'ctrl + 7' to change the languages, you will have to press this twice, because the inputs are going to be filled out already
