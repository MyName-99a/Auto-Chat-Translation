# What is it for?
It is a simple Python tool created for the <b>LEAGUE OF LEGENDS AND VALORANT CHAT</b>, to translate your messages into any Language you want, using the Google Translate library.

# How to use
The default settings are set for translation from 'English' to 'German', and all the translated text is in proper capitalization by default. Hotkeys are shown in the program.

Write some text in the chat, and press the 'right shift' key on your keyboard. It will replace your input with the translation. (Pressing the 'enter' key will reset your sentence.)

# How it works
The program captures every pressed key and detects a word if the 'space' key is pressed. After pressing the 'right shift' key, it forms a sentence from the words captured after the last 'enter' key was pressed (you can see this in the Command Line). After pressing 'enter', a new sentence with new words will start. If you have the chat set to 'enter', you won't have problems with incorrect inputs and translations.

Remember that when the 'space' key is pressed, it captures that word. So, if you are going to delete it, it will still appear in the translation. If you mess up a word, either start the message again or hope that Google Translator will recognize it.

# Known Bugs
1. If the word/sentence you want to translate ends with a 'space', the translation process won't work.
2. After you have translated 3 words/sentences and you press 'ctrl + 7' to change the languages, you will have to press this combination twice, because the inputs will already be filled out.
